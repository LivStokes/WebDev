        <section id="About Me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an aspiring programmer and artist. Throughout my life I have been in search of things that give me joy, 
                such as various hobbies.This includes, my love for sports; hockey, tennis, and fencing. I also have an artistic side; sculpting, painting, writing, and upcycling fashion. 
                Then my geek side comes out, I love video games to a high extent... 
                some would call it an addiction. These hobbies have allowed me to escape from my brutalist reality and enter my own paradise. Its my own form of escapism. </p>

                    <p>Having a bachelor degree in Sociology and Social Policy gave me many career pathways. However, it has been hard choosing which direction I would enjoy the most. 
                    I gained a deeper understanding of how businesses operate and the importance of people in driving success. 
                    I have learned how to create positive work environments by focusing on employee motivation, effective leadership, and fostering diverse and inclusive teams. 
                    I was taught how to manage conflicts, make informed decisions, and adapt to the changing dynamics of the workplace. 
                    These skills have equipped me to contribute to organizational growth and ensure a strong, collaborative culture. 
                    I like this aspect however I have always seen myself as more of a creative person who wants to solve problems and create things.</p>

                <div class="Programming">
                    <p>This is why I am now pursuing the programming route. I already have background knowledge in computers as I have been obsessed with them since I can remember, 
                    this made my choice into integrating to the programming side a lot easier. So, my first project was to build my own personal website. Then I can move on to greater things! 
                    One step at a timeâ€¦ As I continue this journey, I cannot help but reflect on how my passion for problem-solving, creativity, and innovation aligns with the field of programming. 
                    It is a space where I can combine logic with artistry, crafting digital solutions while expressing my unique perspective. 
                    However, stepping into tech as a woman, I have realized just how male-dominated the industry still is.</p>
                    <p>This only fuels my determination. I strongly believe that more women should enter these fields, 
                    not only to bridge the gender gap but to reshape the industry with fresh ideas and diverse perspectives. 
                    Women belong in tech, engineering, finance, and every other industry where we have been historically underrepresented. 
                    The more we break these barriers, the closer we get to true equality.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
                <div class="Feminism">
                    <p>One of the biggest challenges women face in the workforce is the gender pay gap, which persists across multiple industries. 
                    By encouraging more women to step into these high-paying, competitive fields, we can dismantle the outdated norms that have kept us at a disadvantage for so long. Representation matters. 
                    When young girls see women thriving in male-dominated spaces, it inspires them to dream bigger and aim higher.</p>
                    <p>I hope to use my growing expertise in programming to not only advance my own career but to encourage and uplift other women who may feel hesitant about stepping into these spaces. 
                    I want to be part of the change, paving the way for a more equal and inclusive workforce. </p>
                    <p>For now, I am taking things step by step, embracing every challenge and opportunity that comes my way. 
                    My journey is just beginning, but I am excited to see where it leads. With hard work, passion, and a commitment to breaking barriers, 
                    I know that the future holds endless possibilities, not just for me, but for all the women ready to claim their place in the world!</p>
