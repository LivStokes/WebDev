      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am an aspiring programmer and artist. Throughout my life I have been in search of things that give me joy, such as various hobbies.This includes, my love for sports; hockey, tennis, and fencing. I also have an artistic side; sculpting, painting, writing, and upcycling fashion. Then my geek side comes out, I love video games to a high extent... some would call it an addiction. These hobbies have allowed me to escape from my brutalist reality and enter my own paradise. Its my own form of escapism. </p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>Graduating with a bachelors degree in Sociology and Social Policy with a 2.1 GPA gave me a deeper understanding of how businesses operate and the importance of people in driving success. I have learned how to create positive work environments by focusing on employee motivation, effective leadership, and fostering diverse and inclusive teams. I was taught how to manage conflicts, make informed decisions, and adapt to the changing dynamics of the workplace. These skills have equipped me to contribute to organizational growth and ensure a strong, collaborative culture. </p>

  <section id="programming">
    <div class="programming_intro">
      <p>With a background in Sociology and Social Policy, I’ve developed a strong understanding of people, workplaces, and what drives success. I’ve always been curious about how things work — from people to technology. I learned how human systems operate, and now I’m applying that same thinking to the digital world. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_programming">
      <div>
        <p>Programming felt like a natural next step as it’s creative, logical, and constantly evolving. I love building things that are useful and thoughtful. And while tech is still a space where not everyone is equally represented, I see that as even more reason to be here, doing the work, and making space for new voices — one project at a time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Building my personal website was the first step in turning this passion into a career. As I grow in the tech space, I’m especially motivated to break barriers for women in STEM and advocate for more inclusive, diverse, and equitable work environments.</p>
